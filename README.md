The average lifespan spans across roughly 4000 weeks. How far are you along your journey?

Customize your lifepalette by selecting your birthdate, and then clicking on a past week to update its color or add a note for the week. Sign up with your email to save your changes by clicking on the user icon in the navbar. Note: this is a proof of concept and long term availability of your account is not guaranteed. Feel free to print or save the webpage as a .pdf to your liking.

This app is inspired by [Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) by Tim Urban.
